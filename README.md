I'm a software engineer from Indonesia, currently working for a B2B company. I love developing code using JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, AngularJS, and NextJS. Besides coding, I'm also an active writer on Medium, where I share my experiences and knowledge based on real-world experiences. As a frontend team leader in my company, I strive to provide the best solutions for our clients.
